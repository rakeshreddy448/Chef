     Vagrant allows you to easily manage and control multiple virtual machines. It is built on top of VirtualBox and VMWare, and it 
provides many exciting capabilities. You can create isolated development environments, experiment with new products and technologies,
install new versions of existing packages, create your own private data center on your laptop, and run different operating systems.
All that is available in an easy-to-manage and totally safe silo that can't interfere with your main activities and operating system.

Installation
Download the free VirtualBox for your operating system from the VirtualBox website.
After download, just run the binary and install it.
Download Vagrant.
Again, just run the binary to install it.
Initializing Vagrant
Vagrant is a command-line based tool. Once installation is complete, open a console window and create a new directory called 
'vagrant_intro'.
cd ~
 mkdir vagrant_intro
 cd vagrant_intro

This will be your working directory from now on. Inside the vagrant_intro directory, type:

vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

You should see the following text:

A 'Vagrantfile' has been placed in this directory. You are now
 
ready to 'vagrant up' your first virtual environment! Please read
 
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
 
'vagrantup.com' for more information on using Vagrant.
